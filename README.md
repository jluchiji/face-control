# Face Control

FaceControl is an opinionated Express middleware for scoped, role-based access management.
It is heavily inspired by [authorized][1], but attempts to provide a simpler, more
optimized process of both defining and verifying permissions.


## License
Face Control is hereby released under terms of GNU AGPL v3. It means that if you
use this library in a server-side application, you are required to license that
application under GNU AGPL v3 as well and make its source code publicly available.

The reasoning behind this license choice is to discourage our competitors from
using this library while keeping it open source. If you wish to use this library
while keeping your application proprietary, we would be happy to discuss a more
permissive license.
